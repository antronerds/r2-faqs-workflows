R2 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
===========================================

*A collections of questions and answers about the R2 platform*


General questions.
-----


1.  Which platforms does R2- support?
2.  Can I shield my data up to publication?	
3.  Which kind of data does R2 support?
4.  Which expression data platforms are supported by R2?
5.  Can I  analyse my date within a collaborative setting?
6.  Why can't I see survival data in my dataset of interest?
7.  Can I upload my own data?
8.  How can I make corrections to data that I already submitted?
9.  How can I delete my own dataset or make my dataset public?
10. Is there a list of platforms R2 is currently supporting?
11. If I use the datagrabber I don't get the sample annotation with it?



Analysis questions.
-----
	
1. A Gene Ontology analyses results in a category of more then 100 entries how can I identify the individual genes?
2. When I perform a hierarchical clustering how can I cluster for each group separately?
3. When I perform a K-means clustering how  can extract the gene order from the program?
4. When I use the GEO analysis tool and compare the resulting gene list I get a different gene list (70% overlap) compared to the result of the "Find differential expression" option of R2. Is there an explanation for this descrepancy?
5. Using the  R2 grabber I got different expression levels from the same dataset compared to the TCGA alternative
6. How do I retrieve a list of differentially expressed genes between two or more datasets
7. In a certain article the gene name which was linked to a probe identifier gives a different gene name
8. Why cann't I use every dataset in the megasamples analyses


Adapting visuals.

2. Can I generate a SVG-plot with R2.
